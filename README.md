# A pretty blog for hiking storytelling

## Install and develop

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for dependency management. Install and run with the following command:

```sh
yarn
npm run dev
```

Then head to `http://localhost:3000`. Changes you make to components will be reflected there in realtime.

Deploy:
```
now
```

don't have `now` installed? Find it [here](https://zeit.co/download).

## Next steps
